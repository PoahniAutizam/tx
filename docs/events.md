# Updating the Event Engine in TX Ultimate Easy

## Overview of the Event System

The TX Ultimate Easy firmware introduces a powerful
and flexible event system designed to handle various types of interactions,
such as touch gestures and device states.
This system leverages Home Assistant's native event structure,
ensuring seamless integration and enabling users to create advanced automations.

### Event Structure

All events emitted by the device are categorized under the `esphome.tx_ultimate_easy` event type in Home Assistant.
The `data` field within the event payload provides details about the specific interaction.
Below is a detailed description of the keys used:

#### Example Event Payload

```yaml
  event:
    event_type: esphome.tx_ultimate_easy
    data:
      device_id: "abc123"
      device_name: "living_room_panel"
      firmware: "2024.12.1"
      domain: touch
      type: button
      action: click
      button_id: 2
      count: 1
      position: 3
```

### Integration in Automations

#### Listening to Events

To utilize these events in Home Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Developer Tools** in Home Assistant.
2. Navigate to the **Events** tab.
3. Enter `esphome.tx_ultimate_easy` in the "Event to subscribe to" field.
4. Click "Start listening."
5. Trigger interactions on your TX Ultimate Easy device to see the events in real-time.

#### Example Automation YAML

##### Automation for a Single Click

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: esphome.tx_ultimate_easy
    event_data:
      domain: touch
      type: button
      action: click
      button_id: 1
      position: 3
action:
  - service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

##### Automation for a Swipe Gesture

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: esphome.tx_ultimate_easy
    event_data:
      domain: touch
      type: swipe
      action: left
      swipe-direction: left
      position: 3
action:
  - service: script.activate_scene
    target:
      entity_id: scene.relax_mode
```

This event engine provides a robust and extensible framework for handling device interactions,
allowing users to implement highly customized automations with ease.
